Meet up with Glenda
Bury the bone
Call the midwife
Fillet the fish
Feel the noize
Edit the file
Walk the dog
Eat some spinach
Steal the jewels
Read the book
Empty the trash
Shun the sheep
Tweak the twerk
Marry the gnome
Slit the gizzard
Boil the bones
Shred the evidence
Coil the spring
Phone a friend
Calm the nerves
Watch the bird
Prune the rose
Paint the wall
Stoke the fire
Ride the bike
Drive some cattle
Bake a cake
Cut my hair
Oil the joints
Mail the chimp
Pull the string
Mark the text
